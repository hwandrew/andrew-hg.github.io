  <span id="aboutText">So what is this website, exactly?<br /><br />I created this website from scratch as a side project starting December 2017. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I wanted to create a personal portfolio that showcases both my technical abilities and appreciation for aesthetics.<br /><br /><br />So who am I?<br /><br />I am a creative developer studying Computer Science with an Art & Design minor at the University of Michigan. I have gained a deep appreciation for technology &  aesthetics throughout my studies and love to combine the two fields together. Going into college, I always loved creative challenges and had a strong passion for product design, despite my inability to draw. It wasn't until after I had started university where I was introduced to the world of digital media as a medium for creativity, and that is when I transitioned into Computer Science. As I have continued further in my education, both video game development and web development have piqued my interest and are two fields that I would love to further learn about and work in professionally. Beyond being a developer, I consider myself an avid EDM fan, "gamer", amateur photographer, and a fitness lover. I have also recently started to explore 3D modelling with Blender for fun and will be sure to put up some projects I completed here on the website!
