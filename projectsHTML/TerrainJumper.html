    Terrain Jumper is a single-player movement based game developed with C# and the Unity game engine.
    The goal of the game is simple: get from the starting block to the end block, but be sure never to touch the red!
    Players must move the blocks and jump at the same time in order to progress forward.

    The purpose behind this project was to attempt to get a game concept out as quickly as possible to emulate what it is like to begin the development of a new game in the professional field. 
    Students had two weeks to conceptualize and create their games, with the primary goal of it focusing on the functionality rather than the visual aspects. 
    The main challenge for this game stems from programming the player movement and polishing the feel of it. 
    Fair warning: this game is quite hard!
