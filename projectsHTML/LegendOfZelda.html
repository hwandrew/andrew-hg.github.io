    The goal of this project was to re-create the first dungeon level of the original Legend of Zelda using C# and Unity. 
    With assets downloaded from online, all of the time spent on this project was focused on the code behind it all. 
    The game was re-created with one other student and was the first insight into game development for both of us.
    The project introduced me to the foundations of game development as a whole from a technical perspective.
