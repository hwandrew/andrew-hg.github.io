    Lucent Surge is a four player team-based game developed from scratch using the C# and the Unity game engine with three other students. 
    The game splits the players into teams of two with the main objective of the game is to beat the opposing team to the end of the track.
    Players must use their teammates in order to complete the course, where each player must use their abilities to their advantage. 
    Sabotages and obstacles can also be picked up and used on the opposing team to secure the lead!

    From brainstorming concepts and designs all the way to adding visual effects to make the game stand out, the game was completed within two months (after many very late nights). 
    My role in the team focused primarily around the work behind the characters and their interactions as well as the art & visual design of the game. 
    The project provided a wonderful opportunity to not only learn quite a bit about Unity, but also acted as a creative application for programming and problem solving.
